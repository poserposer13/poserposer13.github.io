## Portfolio
I have created a page for myself where I can display biographical information, provide a portfolio of work/personal life, and give a way to get into contact with me. 

## How I did it
I used bootstrap and its grid system to provide myself a layout. I provided a nav-bar that allows for all three pages to be linked together. Each page also has a footer that links to other ways of viewing stuff about me. All the images I added were all responsive to the size of the screen viewing it. That means even if I were to look at it on a mobile device, it will adjust to make it a good fit. I created a form on the contact page that allows for someone to send me an email, with their name and a message. All of this was with the help of bootstrap for their design and grid.

## Why I did it
I created these web applications so that I can easily give examples of what I have accomplished and a little about me. This will be helpful as time goes on because I will be able to continually update this to better reflect what I have done for future employers. This is also a good way to allow other people I am working with to see a little more about me and what I can do.
